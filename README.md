# JavaScript Pizzeria

A project to try out some vital yet basic JavaScript, like variables, conditionals and native methods. Pure coding, no web page fuss.

## The problem

I started out working with if statements for conditionals, and trying out different ways to store the user's input. When I was finished, I created a new .js file, the switch.js where I replaced the if conditionals with switch statements.
I'm still not sure which way is the right one, but it was educational and fun to play around!
